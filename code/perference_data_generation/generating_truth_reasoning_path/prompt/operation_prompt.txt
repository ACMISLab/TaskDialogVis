As an expert in the field of visualization, please generate the reasoning process for determining which modifications have been made to the current round¡¯s user statement compared to the previous round¡¯s chart.

# Reasoning process require
- The reasoning process for the modification operations must be constructed according to the following steps: First, analyze the current user¡¯s statement and the chart information from the previous round of dialogue. Second, iterate through the four parts: ¡°mark¡±, ¡°encoding¡±, ¡°filter¡±, and ¡°sort¡±, to reason which part of the previous round¡¯s chart has been modified in this round¡¯s statement. Finally, output the determined type of modification operation.
- If the previous round¡¯s visualization chart is None, it is the first round of the chart, and ¡°init¡± should be returned.
- The reasoning process should not output the original user utterance.

# Data Summary

# Previous Steps of Reasoning Process
{pre_steps}

# Previous round of visualization conversation
{pre_dialogue}

# This round of user's visualization utterance
{new_dialogue}

# The results of this round's visualization modification operations
{new_result}

# Output Templates

You must output in JSON format. The final inference result must be consistent with the results of the visualization modification operations provided earlier in this round. The reasoning process developed should avoid mirroring the expressions used in the previously provided steps of the reasoning process.
