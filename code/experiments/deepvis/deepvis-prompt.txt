Please generate VQL by reasoning step by step, based on the following Question, Database Schema, the VQL from the previous turn, and Constraints.

Question:
{question}

Database Schema:
{dataset}

VQL from the previous turn:
{pre}

The VQL template is as follows:
Visualize [VISUALIZE_TYPE]
SELECT [SELECT_COLUMNS]
FROM [FROM_TABLES]
WHERE [WHERE_CONDITION]
GROUP BY [GROUP_BY_COLUMNS]
ORDER BY [ORDER_BY_COLUMNS] [ORDER_BY_DIRECTION]
LIMIT [LIMIT_NUMBER]
BIN [BIN_COLUMN] BY [BIN_TIME_UNIT]

The constraints for each part are as follows:
1. VISUALIZE field: Only BAR, PIE, LINE, and SCATTER are allowed as values. It is used to specify the data visualization chart type of the query results. Analyze the nature of the question and the database schema to explain why the [TYPE] in the Pre - entered Correct VQL is chosen.
2. SELECT field: There must be exactly two columns from the database in the SELECT clause. These columns must be either directly from the columns listed in the Database Schema or valid derivations based on those columns (COUNT, AVG, MAX and MIN). Explain why the [COLUMNS] in the Pre - entered Correct VQL are selected considering the question and the database schema.
3. FROM field: Only add the table names that must be used to complete the natural - language query. Evaluate the question and the database schema to explain why the [TABLES] in the Pre - entered Correct VQL are necessary to answer the question. Describe the connection between these tables and the data required by the question.
4. WHERE field: Analyze the natural - language query and the database schema to determine whether there is a filtering requirement. When there are clear limiting conditions, accurately explain why the WHERE clause logic expressions in the Pre - entered Correct VQL are formed this way, considering the conditional logical relationships to match the query intent. The columns used in the conditions must be from the Database Schema or valid derivations.
5. Grouping:
If you need to group or aggregate the time column in the SELECT clause by a time unit (day, weekday, month, or year) and the current table does not have a column that meets this time - unit requirement, then use the BIN [BIN_COLUMN] BY [BIN_TIME_UNIT] part. [BIN_COLUMN] should be a time column from the Database Schema, and [BIN_TIME_UNIT] should be the appropriate time unit (day, weekday, month, or year).
When the dataset needs to be grouped and it is not related to time, add other columns in the GROUP BY clause as grouping bases in sequence, with earlier - used grouping bases placed more forward. The columns in the GROUP BY clause must be from the Database Schema or valid derivations. Explain why the GROUP BY and BIN (if applicable) parts in the Pre - entered Correct VQL are set up based on the question and the database schema.
6. LIMIT field: Add a LIMIT clause at the end of the VQL to specify the maximum number of rows to return. If there is no limit requirement, leave it empty. Explain why the LIMIT clause (if present) in the Pre - entered Correct VQL is included or not, considering factors such as the amount of data needed to answer the question and performance implications.

Step 3:
Reasoning for GROUP BY: [Explain why the columns in the GROUP BY clause of the Pre - entered Correct VQL are used for grouping based on the question and the database schema]

Reasoning for ORDER BY: [Explain why the columns in the ORDER BY clause of the Pre - entered Correct VQL are used for sorting based on the question and the database schema]
ORDER BY: [Columns for the ORDER BY clause from the Pre - entered Correct VQL]
Reasoning for SORT DIRECTION: [Based on the analysis of the question requirements and the database schema, explain why the ASC or DESC (or empty) in the Pre - entered Correct VQL is used for each column in the ORDER BY clause]
SORT DIRECTION: [ASC|DESC|empty from the Pre - entered Correct VQL]
Reasoning for LIMIT: [Explain why the LIMIT clause (if present) in the Pre - entered Correct VQL is set as such based on various factors]
LIMIT: [Number of rows for the LIMIT clause from the Pre - entered Correct VQL]

Step 5:
Final VQL Answer

Step 1:
Reasoning for Chart Type: The question explicitly asks for a bar chart to display the number of faculty members for each faculty rank. A bar chart is specifically useful for comparing discrete categories (faculty ranks in this case), allowing one to visualize differences in counts. Given that we need to show counts across different ranks, a bar chart is the most suitable choice.
Chart Type: BAR

Step 2:
Reasoning for FROM: The required data to answer the question relates to faculty ranks and their counts, which can be directly sourced from the `faculty` table in the database schema. This table contains the ranking information, making it the only necessary table to retrieve the required information about faculty.
FROM: Faculty
Reasoning for SELECT: The columns chosen for the SELECT clause include `Rank` and `COUNT(RANK)`. The `Rank` column corresponds to the ranks of faculty members, which directly addresses the question's focus. The `COUNT(RANK)` is an aggregate function that counts how many faculty have each rank, allowing us to fulfill the question's requirement of showing the number of faculty members per rank.
SELECT: Rank, COUNT(RANK)

Reasoning for WHERE: There are no specific filtering requirements indicated by the question. It does not state any need to limit the results based on any faculty characteristics (e.g., age, sex) or any activity participation criteria, meaning the full data from the `faculty` table is relevant.
WHERE: [No conditions]

Step 3:
Reasoning for GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause includes `rank` because we need to aggregate the data by faculty rank to count the number of faculty members for each distinct rank. This grouping is essential for achieving the desired counts that the question requests.
GROUP BY: rank
Reasoning for BIN: The BIN clause is not applicable here because the data being aggregated is not time-related, and the question does not specify any time-based grouping.
BIN: [No BIN column]
BY: [No. BIN time unit]

Step 4:
Reasoning for ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause includes `COUNT(RANK)`, which indicates that we want the results to be sorted based on the number of faculty members per rank. This provides clarity in understanding the most to least populous ranks, which is significant as per the question's requirements.
ORDER BY: COUNT(RANK)
Reasoning for SORT DIRECTION: The direction is set to DESC, as the question specifies wanting to display the counts from high to low, thus showing the ranks with the highest number of faculty members first.
SORT DIRECTION: DESC
Reasoning for LIMIT: There is no specific limit stated in the question, indicating that we should retrieve all ranks and counts without truncating the results. Therefore, leaving the LIMIT clause empty is appropriate, as we want to present a comprehensive view of all faculty ranks.
LIMIT: [Empty]

Step 5:
Final VQL:Visualize BAR SELECT Rank , count(Rank) FROM Faculty GROUP BY rank ORDER BY count(Rank) DESC
